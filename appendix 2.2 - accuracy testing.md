# accuracy testing - **[whisper AI](https://openai.com/index/whisper/)** vs **[gensim and NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/howto/gensim.html)**:

<br>
This comparison report was created by analyzing transcription and summary creation data using the Openai version of whisper AI and the free version of gensim and NLTK. There are [9707 presidential campaign ads](https://vimeo.com/showcase/11287923) used as the fileset. The length of the ads varies from 15 seconds to 1 minute.

## columns in the dataset:
   - `adamfile name`: The name of the file being processed.
   - `adamsummary`: Summaries generated using Whisper AI.
   - `jasummary`: Summaries generated using Gensim and NLTK.
   - `adamtranscripts`: Transcripts generated by Whisper AI.
   - `jatranscript`: Transcripts generated using the `speech_recognition` and `moviepy` libraries.
   - `transcription similarity score (%)`: Percentage similarity between the two transcript generation methods (Whisper AI and `speech_recognition`).
   - `summary similarity score`: Percentage similarity between summaries generated by Whisper AI and Gensim/NLTK.
   - `scoring explanation`: Additional notes explaining the context and differences in the generated summaries.

## key observations:
   - **Transcription Similarity Score**: The similarity between Whisper AI transcripts and `speech_recognition` transcripts ranges widely, from as low as 18.03% to over 95%. This indicates the varying performance of the two transcription methods, possibly due to different audio qualities or transcription methods used in each tool.


   - **Summary Similarity Score**: The scores also vary significantly, with some files showing nearly identical summaries (e.g., 96-98% similarity), while others have lower scores (e.g., 12-30%). This could be due to differences in summarization algorithms and their focus.


   - **Scoring Explanations**: The explanations provide insights into why certain summaries or transcripts might be similar or differ. For example, both texts may discuss the same themes but may differ in wording or structure, impacting similarity scores.

## Detailed Examples:
   - For file `P-1004-40264`, the transcription similarity is low (18.03%), but the scoring explanation suggests that both texts cover the same themes of diversity and vastness in the U.S.
   - For file `P-1007-40407`, both transcription similarity and summary similarity are very high (96.31% and 98.12% respectively), indicating that both Whisper AI and Gensim/NLTK summarized the content similarly, with the scoring explanation confirming both cover a similar subject.

## Recommendations:
- Files with low transcription or summary similarity scores may need closer inspection to determine whether one method consistently outperforms the other.
- Higher similarity scores indicate better alignment between the two tools, so these files may not need further attention unless other issues are detected.
