  ## follow-up documentation (9/27/2023)

  When re-processing the physcial collections many layers of complexities were discovered. This page documents the problems and solutions. 

**Assumptions**
  1. In the large cold room storage area were two seperate groups of boxes which were numbered with labels, written/typed including a large font number and below were additional numbers.
      * Section one included 15 rows of 5 shelves with white plactic archival storage containers with labels on each ranging from 1-928 with additional numbers included below.
      * Section two included 15 rows of 5 shelves , mix box types (plastic and standard archival storage boxes) with labels ranging 1-1108 with additional numbers included below.
  2. The assumption was section one included film and older audio/video formats (16mm, 8mm, 1' videotape, 2" videotape, magnetic tape (sound)) and section two included the migrated copies (3/4" videotape, Beta SP, VHS, other iterations to include casseettes, etc...)

**Problems**
1. The boxes in both sections did not link/match [box 1 in section one did not coincide with box 1 in section 2]
2. The items inside of the boxes did not match the labels in most occassions, insie of the boxes [box 1 with items 32556-32564 were not the items in the boxes on the documentation that we have]
3. Each box contained items that may or may not have a record of their existence on the documentation that we have compiled and readily available.
4. Items without representation in the documentation were checked by visually matching any numbers on the item to the master worksheet, matching election years or dates, candidates, formats, titles.
5. Some items twere matched to multiple elements of the worksheet [i.e. title, election year, candidate] but missing unique identifiers or containing misidentified identification were noted
