## component identification (P_COPY-OID)

With multiple decades separating many of the acquired materials and entirely different personnel responsible for development of the Collection, information utilized to record collection data has proven to be highly inconsistent. Identifying the most used categorization that signified a sense of order was recognized as a priority when standardizing and formatting the collection. Compiled data analysis helped uncover relationships and associations between the identification numbers and other data elements. This enabled a deeper understanding of how each identification number was utilized and interconnected within the records.
During the process of integrating the collection data and formatting the available records, a closer examination revealed the need for a primary and secondary identification number . It became apparent that the P_COPY identification number served as a top-level grouping container, encompassing various item-level components referred to as OID numbers. This insight provided a deeper understanding of the hierarchical structure within the dataset and facilitated more granular analysis and organization.

### redundancy â€“ 2

The amalgamation of the P_COPY and OID numbers resulted in the creation of the Unique ID, which serves as a categorical identifier for individual ads in the collection. In order to ensure data accuracy and avoid redundancy, additional redundancy checks were implemented after integrating the collection data. It is common for files in the collection to have multiple iterations, including both digital and analog items that have not been digitized yet.
As an example, during text analysis, two files, P-1139-49189 and P-1935-130892, showed a high similarity score. However, further analysis through video examination revealed that these files were distinct and not similar. This process helped to clarify and differentiate between the files, ensuring accurate categorization and avoiding duplication.
