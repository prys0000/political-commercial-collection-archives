## component identification (P_COPY-OID)

With multiple decades separating many of the acquired materials and entirely different personnel responsible for development of the Collection, information utilized to record collection data has proven to be highly inconsistent. Identifying the most used categorization that signified a sense of order was recognized as a priority when standardizing and formatting the collection. Compiled data analysis helped uncover relationships and associations between the identification numbers and other data elements. This enabled a deeper understanding of how each identification number was utilized and interconnected within the records.

During the process of integrating the collection data and formatting the available records, a closer examination revealed the need for a primary and secondary identification number . It became apparent that the P_COPY identification number served as a top-level grouping container, encompassing various item-level components referred to as OID numbers. This insight provided a deeper understanding of the hierarchical structure within the dataset and facilitated more granular analysis and organization.

The amalgamation of the P_COPY and OID numbers resulted in the creation of the Unique ID, which serves as a categorical identifier for the individual ads in the collection. After reviewing the newly created catalog of data it was discovered that further analyses were needed. Many files within the collection can have multiple iterations represented in the collected data, digital files, or analog items not yet digitized. 
For instance, after conducting text analysis, two files, P-1139-49189 and P-1935-130892, were found to have a high similarity score. To gain further clarity and differentiate between these files, additional video analysis was performed. Video analysis clearly identified the two files as unsimilar.
