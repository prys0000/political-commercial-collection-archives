## collection growth and initial issues

The initial estimate suggests that the collection had around 25,000 items in 1985, primarily consisting of presidential ads, along with groups of congressional and gubernatorial ads from the years 1952 to 1956. These ads encompassed approximately 700 unique candidate names. 

The collection is comprehensive, covering all 50 states of the United States. Additionally, it extends its reach to political ads from various countries and regions around the world. These include Afghanistan, Aruba, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Europe, Germany, Greece, Guam, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Soviet Union, Tasmania, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Virgin Islands, and Yugoslavia.

Over time, the collection has significantly grown and now encompasses 4,677 unique candidate names, spanning a period of 104 years . It includes a wide range of political offices including expanded state, city, county campaigns and represents 40 political parties. The collection also includes over 1,500 identified production agencies or political action committees as creators .

The considerable scale of the Collection and its varied content presented substantial challenges and complexities during the (re)ingestion, (re)inventorying, and cataloging processes. Legacy information was not provided in initial acquisition efforts which would account for collection verification, changes in structure, or integrity checking. 

The compilation of collection notes, catalogs, inventories, historical references, rights verification, licensing, and other documentation related to the collection involves extensive investigation and manual research, spanning tens of thousands of handwritten and typed written pages. These materials provide comprehensive documentation and insights into the collection's contents, history, and significance. However, managing this vast amount of information poses a challenge as these resources are scattered across numerous storage locations. This documentation is often found on outdated media or in non-electronic formats, necessitating the use of digital forensic procedures to extract and consolidate data for analysis .

### text standardization

Once the necessary documentation is collected, text analysis plays a crucial role in extracting and formatting the data in a coherent and organized manner. However, the raw text often contains various challenges that can hinder the analysis process.

Text standardization is the process of ensuring consistency and quality in the textual data. It involves transforming the raw text into a standardized format that adheres to predefined rules and guidelines. By standardizing the text, we can overcome several barriers that may arise during analysis. 

By implementing standardization methodologies, we can effectively resolve inconsistencies related to names, misspellings, language or linguistic issues, the usage of acronyms, and industry-specific terminology. This allows for the creation of a controlled vocabulary or a thesaurus, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the ongoing processing and analysis of text data. This is particularly beneficial in academic archives or environments with high student turnover, where maintaining accurate and consistent documentation is essential.


### broad headings

Upon acquisition of the Collection, ads were categorized into broad or umbrella levels for campaign offices represented as well as political parties, formats, and other descriptive data. Offices and campaigns were organized by general identification including ‘City and County Offices’, ‘Other Campaign Offices’, and ‘International Offices’, for example. 

Identifying specific campaign offices within the generalized headings requires additional extensive data research and analysis. Development of new archival groupings would be instrumental in long-term collection access and discoverability.

### redundant files

Redundancy in archival repositories refers to files that contain duplicate content and information, leading to unnecessary data duplication. This duplication not only consumes storage space but also creates confusion and impacts system management. However, redundancy within a collection goes beyond simple file duplication. It involves minor variations that are often overlooked during initial analyses, presenting significant challenges.
Additionally, collection ads often share common titles or themes, such as 'Victory,' 'Crime,' or 'Bio,' which present exceptional challenges due to the large number of ads involved. The (re)processing of the collection becomes even more complex when attempting to identify variations or similarities among them.
Video composition or production elements and standards often result in intricate discrepancies, including shared titles or themes. Despite similar description elements, extent, scope, and contents, the ads may exhibit slight variations in music, text overlays, objects within video frames, and other visual aspects. These differences create unique collection items and require accurate analysis and categorization of the ads.

Political campaign-focused marketing strategies frequently require making minor adjustments and edits to the ads, leading to the creation of new 'unique' items customized for specific regional locations, marketing analyses, and other factors. These modifications encompass a range of changes, such as subtle alterations in depicted objects, variations in background materials, adjustments to the colors of buildings, cars, and people, and even slight modifications to the theme song or background music.

The image exhibits a common issue within the collection. In comparison of two files, P-1463-71759 and P-1463-71760, both digital files appear to be possible duplicates with same digital file size and length of video. The metadata representing the files included exact title, creator, extent, and dates, however, when analyzing video data, the videos were not duplicate ads.

Additionally initial analysis of the collection indicated inconsistencies with candidate names, parties, or other descriptive attributes. Some variations may be more challenging to detect, such as non-standard frame heights or widths, which are sometimes employed to adhere to network limitations or address copyright concerns during later stages of ad design.

In order to identify and analyze the collection in greater detail, extract additional pattern of errors or variation requires the use of comparison algorithms and collection specific methodologies. By developing fundamental platforms of analysis, the level of similarity or differences between files can be measured more accurately to depict uniqueness. This approach contributes to the effective organization of the collection and ensures that each item is accurately classified based on its specific characteristics .
