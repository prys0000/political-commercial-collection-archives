# collection growth and initial issues

The initial estimate suggests that the collection had around 25,000 items in 1985, primarily consisting of presidential ads, along with groups of congressional and gubernatorial ads from the years 1952 to 1956. These ads encompassed approximately 700 unique candidate names. 

The collection is comprehensive, covering all 50 states of the United States. Additionally, it extends its reach to political ads from various countries and regions around the world. These include Afghanistan, Aruba, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Europe, Germany, Greece, Guam, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Soviet Union, Tasmania, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Virgin Islands, and Yugoslavia.

Over time, the collection has significantly grown and now encompasses 4,677 unique candidate names, spanning a period of 104 years[^1]. It includes a wide range of political offices including expanded state, city, county campaigns and represents 40 political parties. The collection also includes over 1,500 identified production agencies or political action committees as creators[^2].

The considerable scale of the Collection and its varied content presented substantial challenges and complexities during the (re)ingestion, (re)inventorying, and cataloging processes. Legacy information was not provided in initial acquisition efforts which would account for collection verification, changes in structure, or integrity checking. 

The compilation of collection notes, catalogs, inventories, historical references, rights verification, licensing, and other documentation related to the collection involves extensive investigation and manual research, spanning tens of thousands of handwritten and typed written pages. These materials provide comprehensive documentation and insights into the collection's contents, history, and significance. However, managing this vast amount of information poses a challenge as these resources are scattered across numerous storage locations. This documentation is often found on outdated media or in non-electronic formats, necessitating the use of digital forensic procedures to extract and consolidate data for analysis[^3].
