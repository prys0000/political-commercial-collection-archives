## physical re-processing, arrangement, identification 

The Center's primary mission is the tasks of re-digitizing and migrating the extensive Collection, of over approximately 120,000 individual advertisements. This includes format conversion, re-arrangement, re-processing, preservation, and rehousing of the entire collection. Adding to the complexity, the ads include various historical formats, including 16mm film, 1" videotape, 2" videotape, U-Matic videotape, 3/4" videotape, VHS, Betamax, DVC, DVD, and more. 

The significant challenge is the fact that most of these items lack mis-identified or improperly documented identification numbers, requiring extensive research. 

### physical inspection

During the re-processing of our physical collections, we encountered various complexities, which we have documented on this page along with their corresponding solutions. 


1. In the large cold room storage area, we identified two separate groups of boxes. Each box had a label with a large-font number, and additional numbers were listed below:
    * Section one consisted of 15 rows of 5 shelves with white plastic archival storage containers, numbered from 1 to 928 with additional numbers below.
    * Section two contained 15 rows of 5 shelves with a mix of box types (plastic and standard archival storage boxes), numbered from 1 to 1108 with additional numbers below.
2. We assumed that section one housed film and older audio/video formats (such as 16mm, 8mm, 1" videotape, 2" videotape, and magnetic tape), while section two contained migrated copies (3/4" videotape, Beta SP, VHS, and other iterations, including cassettes, etc.).

**initial issues**
1. Boxes in both sections did not align, meaning that "box 1" in section one did not correspond to "box 1" in section two.
2. Contents inside the boxes often did not match the labels, causing discrepancies. For instance, "box 1" with items 32556-32564 did not contain the items listed in our documentation.
3. Each box contained items that may or may not have been documented elsewhere.
4. Items not found in our documentation were cross-referenced visually by matching numbers, election years, dates, candidates, formats, and titles.
5. Some items matched multiple elements of our documentation (e.g., title, election year, candidate) but lacked unique identifiers or contained misidentified information.
