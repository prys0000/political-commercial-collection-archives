This script compares two text files and identifies the differing words between them using the difflib library. It then saves the differing words to a new text file called differing_words.txt.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

Import the SequenceMatcher class from the difflib library.

Define the compare_text_files function, which takes two file paths (file1 and file2) as inputs.

Read the contents of the first file (file1) and store it in the variable text1.

Read the contents of the second file (file2) and store it in the variable text2.

Split the contents of both files into individual words using the split() method.

Compare the words from both files to find differing words. The script uses the symmetric difference (^) operator on sets of words (set(words1) and set(words2)) to find words that are unique to each file.

Save the differing words to a new text file called differing_words.txt. The script opens the file in write mode ('w') and writes each differing word to a new line in the file.

Print a message indicating that the differing words have been saved to differing_words.txt.

Provide the paths to the two text files (file1_path and file2_path).

Call the compare_text_files function with the provided file paths to perform the comparison.

The script is useful for identifying differences between two text files and can be used for text comparison tasks, such as checking the variations between different versions of a document or detecting changes in content between two similar files.
